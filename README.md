A Version & Package Manager for the QuarticC programming language.

---

## Overview

QCM has 2 sections, `tooling` and core.
Tooling commands install and update the compiler version, while core installs packages.

---

## Why Use QCM?

`qcm` to C⁴ is equivelent to everythign except `go run` in the `go` tool to Go.
It's a neccesary part of C⁴ development.

## Example
```bash
qcm tooling install latest
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
qcm init
```

## Project Structure

QuarticC projects have this structure:

```graph

. MyProject
├─┐ dependencies/
│ ├┐ MyDependencyNumber1/
│ │└─ lib.qc
│ ╵
├─┐ docs/
│ ├─ index.md
│ ╵
├─┐ lib/
│ ├─ lib.qc
